    Day 2 of html practice<br>
    We will learn more about html<br>
    and its elements<br>
    <p>This p element is for paragraph</p>
    also we have C<sub>6</sub> H <sub>12</sub> O <sub>6</sub> <br>
    we have 2 <sup>2</sup> &plus; 2 <sup>2</sup> &equals; 8 <br>
    <i>idiomatic text</i> <br>
    I always forget the br element, guess will have to memorize it more. <br>
    <div>Div element is a block level element.</div>
    <div>as we can clearly see here.</div>
    <span>span is an inline element</span>
    <span>as we can clearly see here.</span><br>
    heading elements are: <br>
    <h1>Largest heading</h1>
    <h2>Less than h1</h2>
    <h3>Less than h2</h3>
    <h4>And so on till h6 </h4>
    <h1>HTML ENTITIES</h1>
    &gt; & gt is the entity for greater than sign. <br>
    &lt; & lt is the entitiy for lesser than sign. <br>
    &amp; & amp is the entity for showing & sign. <br>
    &quot; & quot is the entity for starting a quote. <br>
    <em>emphasis text</em> <br>
    ANy language is easy if we give our 100% to it. <br>
    So, with this we come to the end of our 2nd practice session.
